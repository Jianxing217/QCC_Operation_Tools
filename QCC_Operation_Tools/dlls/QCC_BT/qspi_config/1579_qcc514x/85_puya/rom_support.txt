The following devices have ROM support and do not need MIB keys:

Puya P25Q32L(*)
Puya P25Q32LE
Puya P25Q64L(*)
Puya P25Q64LE

Note: QSPI parts marked with (*) cannot perform quad reads at 80MHz. On CSRA68105 devices,
      the 80 or 120MHz clock source is divided by 2. QCC512x and QCC514x devices do
      not use the clock divider and therefore the SqifClockControl MIB key must be
      configured such that these QSPI parts use the 32MHz crystal clock source.
      
      QSPI Parts without this marking do not impose a clock restriction, however, on QCC512x
      devices, the 80MHz PLL clock source may only be used after analysis of board layout and 
      total load capacitance proves that timing constraints can be met. Seek guidance from 
      Qualcomm before considering use of the 80MHz clock source for these parts.


The following QSPI parts can not be supported at all due to issues with erase/program
suspend/resume implementation:

Puya P25Q80L
Puya P25Q80LE
Puya P25Q16L
Puya P25Q16LE
